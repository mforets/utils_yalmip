# utils_yalmip
Helper functions that interface with [YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/), with a focus on polynomial optimization problems. Features: 

- Generation of moments for "simple" sets (p-norm balls). 
- Utility functions to interface with [Gloptipoly](http://homepages.laas.fr/henrion/software/gloptipoly/).
- Integration of sdpvar polynomials.
- Plotting of polynomials in one or several variables: scalar plots, surface plots, superlevel-set plots.
